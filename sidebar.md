# Sidebar Improvements

- [x] Subtle MindBloom brand accent for active nav indicator and active icon only.
- [x] Reduce inactive icon contrast and visual noise in nav list.
- [x] Refine top bar hierarchy (search dominant, utilities quieter, slight height reduction).
- [x] Improve workflow overview hierarchy (section titles stronger, arrows quieter, inner cards calmer).
- [x] Add tenant context line (“Administrator workspace”) without changing sidebar width.

Notes:
- No gradients, decorative elements, or new borders added.
- All updates use existing tokens for color and spacing.
